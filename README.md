# Image-Classifier
Uses ml5 and Tensor flow to analyse images and report back on cofidence values based on provided models from Google's Teachable Machine.

## Instructions
To test as is, take the files in the repo and run the index.html in a web browser. Use the file-picker to upload an image from your local drive. Click submit and wait for the agent to run the image against the models. To add more models, update the ml.js to include new `Promises` providing the exported link to the model from Teachable Machine.
